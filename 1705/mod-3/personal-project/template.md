## Project Name:

TBD

#### Check In: 1

#### Project Pitch

I want to make an app where a user can create an account, add their favorite books, and then click on a book to get a recommendation 
on what they should read next. I also want them to be able to make multiple selections to get a recommendation based on multiple books.
Users should also be able to organize their books into lists.

### Deliverables

I want to deliver a fullstack app with the features I just listed, but I need feedback on whether my pitch is too ambitious or not ambitous enough.

#### Stack:

I'll probably need a backend if I want to let users make accounts, right?

#### APIs:

Goodreads API, maybe the Google Books API and LibraryThing API.

#### Order Of Attack

I think I'll have a better idea of this after my first checkin. I know that I definitely need to start getting familiar with 
what the data will look like from Goodreads, and I need to figure out whether I'll need a backend. My plan is to use React and Redux, 
so I want to get my Redux hooked up as soon as possible. I'll also need to figure out my logic for generating recommendations. 

#### MVP

A user should be able to add a favorite book, click on it, and then see a recommendation displayed.

#### Nice To Haves

I'd like to try using TypeScript. I think I'll probably start writing in vanilla JavaScript and then convert to TypeScript as I 
go.

#### Biggest Challenges

Backend stuff and deciding how to generate good, logical recommendations.
